## List of homework

(For each homework, the used programming languages, technologies and tools are in square brackets)

- **Homework 0**: a calculator prototype written in Java and tested with JUnit. [Java]
- **Homework 1**: a toy Doodle RESTful web service written in Java using the Spring framework. [Java, REST, Spring]
- **Homework 2**: a web service that takes an IP address (of a server) as input and returns the current weather in the city in which the server is located, orchestrated from the [IP2Geo Web Service](https://ws.cdyne.com/ip2geo/ip2geo.asmx) and the [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org) service with WS-BPEL using the [OpenESB](http://www.open-esb.net) framework. [XML, OpenESB, WSDL, BPEL, SOAP, REST]
- **Homework 3**: a web service that takes an airport code (e.g. PSA) as input and returns the airport's full name and time zone, orchestrated with WS-BPEL (managing faults) from two [WebServiceX](http://www.webservicex.net/new/Home/Index) using the OpenESB framework. [XML, OpenESB, WSDL, BPEL, SOAP, REST]
- **Homework 4**: the modeling of a WS-BPEL process using a workflow net, created with the [WoPeD](http://woped.dhbw-karlsruhe.de/woped/) tool. [BPEL, workflow nets, WoPeD]
- **Homework 5**: a Bash script that writes a quote (either passed as argument or generated with a "fortune-telling" program) in [cowthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowthink), deployed as a Docker image built from a Dockerfile and then run in a Docker container. [Bash, Docker]
- **Homework 6**: the toy Doodle web service from Homework 1, described with the TOSCA language and deployed in a Docker container using the [TosKer](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/TosKer) and [TosKeriser](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/TosKeriser) tools.
